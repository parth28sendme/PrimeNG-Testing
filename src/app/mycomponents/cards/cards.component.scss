Designed and Implemented a Standalone Angular Component (BotDetectionDetailsComponent):
Utilized Angular’s standalone component architecture to encapsulate all functionality—HTML template, SCSS styles, and TypeScript logic—resulting in a self-contained, easily maintainable module for bot detection insights. Leveraged dependency injection to integrate services such as BotDetectionService, BotIdentificationService, ExclusionService, and MemberService, ensuring consistent data access and role-based UI behavior.

Built Real‐Time Data Fetching and Error Handling with RxJS:
Orchestrated multiple asynchronous API calls (e.g., GetData2, GetIdentificationData, GetExclusivesData, GetGUIId) using RxJS operators (pipe, takeUntil, finalize, catchError). Implemented robust error recovery and loading‐state management (setting IsLoading, ExclusiveLoading, IdentificationLoading) to ensure the UI remained responsive even under high‐latency or failure conditions.

Developed Dynamic Data Visualization with PrimeNG and Chart.js:
Integrated PrimeNG’s <p-chart> (wrapping Chart.js) to render hour‐wise bot activity line charts. Transformed raw API payloads into Chart.js–compatible structures (labels and datasets) via a custom transformData() function. Incorporated dynamic theming logic (getColor(), ColourTheme()) to toggle between “Malicious,” “Friendly,” “Human,” and “All Bots” views—update both chart colors and data filters in real-time for focused analysis.

Implemented Responsive, Role‐Based Filtering and Pagination:
Employed PrimeNG’s <p-calendar> for date-range selection and <p-multiSelect> for network‐group and network filtering, adapting visibility based on user roles (RolesIds). Calculated pagination (calculateTotalPages(), updatePaginatedData()) and implemented sorting logic (sortColumn(), getSortIcon()) to provide intuitive table navigation and efficient data‐driven decision-making for adtech account managers.

Created Interactive Data Tables with PrimeNG Table Components:
Configured PrimeNG <p-table> instances for:

Traffic Activity Log: Displayed paginated bot visit records (fields: bot type, URL, date, time) with sortable columns and row‐level detail access (via a clickable “ellipsis” icon triggering a <p-sidebar>).

Real‐Time Block Lists: Showed exclusion lists for Google Ads, Meta, and TikTok, dynamically switching between platforms using <button> groups, with separate <p-table> definitions for each data schema (e.g., IP addresses, ad IDs, country flags).

Integrated Clipboard Functionality and JSON Detail Views:
Employed Angular CDK’s Clipboard service to allow users to copy formatted JSON objects—both bot visit details and generated BotStop JavaScript snippets—to the clipboard. Displayed nested JSON in a <pre> block inside a PrimeNG <p-sidebar>, enabling smooth inspection and exporting of detection responses.

Developed a Guided BotStop Setup Workflow with Multi‐Step Dialogs:
Designed a multi‐level PrimeNG <p-dialog> (“Setup Bot Stop”) that guides network administrators through:

Selecting Agency and Network (using <p-dropdown>)

Fetching a unique GUIId via GetGUIId() and rendering it in a copyable code snippet (template literal injection)

Performing verification (verifyUser()) with real‐time feedback on integration success—displayed via an icon‐based confirmation dialog.

Implemented a 24‐Hour Traffic Feed with Conditional Rendering:
Provided an alternative “24-Hour Traffic Feed” view toggled by a button group. When enabled, the component fetches and displays visitor logs from the past 24 hours (via GetIdentificationData()). Each record is parsed to extract nested fields (safeJSONParse()) and displayed in a separate data table with its own <p-sidebar> details panel.

Optimized User Experience with Conditional Styling and Tooltips:
Applied dynamic inline styles ([ngStyle]) for selected states—buttons, cards, and table headers—to maintain a cohesive color theme driven by user selection (e.g., #FA6400 for “Malicious,” #28C76F for “Friendly,” etc.). Integrated PrimeNG tooltips (pTooltip) on icons (info circles) to clarify UI controls and guide end-users through the analytics interface.

Ensured Maintainability and Scalability Through Modular Code Practices:

Segregated chart configuration (__FinalChartCounts) and data transformation logic (transformData()) into discrete methods.

Centralized state variables (e.g., __TotalCounts, __BotVisitsData, __NetworkGroups) to manage shared data across multiple UI sections.

Adopted clear naming conventions, thorough in-line comments, and consistent error‐logging (via console.log) to facilitate rapid debugging and future feature enhancements.
